# lab-preview

## Introduction

This is a website John Thorp made in September 2021 to allow centralize and document the various opportunities for undergraduates in the department, primarily concerning RA recruitment across all the main labs and any other labs from across Columbia that want in on the haul.

Being a github site under the cu-psych-computing domain is intended to make it flexible and easy to update, at least relative to it being on any official Columbia page. I am aware that proper documentation for how exactly to edit it makes that much easier. I hope this README makes editing the website bearable.

## Software

In Terminal, navigate to an empty folder and type ```git clone https://github.com/cu-psych-computing/lab-preview```, press enter. This should clone the repo onto your computer.

All editing is done in RStudio (R version = 4.0.3) using the blogdown package (version = 1.4). You will need to call the install_hugo function to install hugo on your machine.
