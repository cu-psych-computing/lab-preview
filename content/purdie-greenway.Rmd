## Research Projects

Work on research exploring identity, diversity, and intergroup cooperation and how these processes affect individual performance and health. Gain valuable research skills using a variety of methods, from field studies to psychophysiological measures. Prepare yourself for graduate school with mentoring and journal discussions.
 
### Identity Threat, Health, and Intervention

What is the effect of contending with negative stereotypes or other threats to identity on subjective stress, physiological stress, health outcomes, and intellectual performance? How can we intervene to mitigate these harmful effects?
### Structure of equality

What structural factors influence racial and gender diversity, or lack thereof, in hiring? How do institutions influence the publicâ€™s understanding of race-related events and perpetuate inequality?

### Intersectionality

Do people ignore or pay closer attention to people with multiple stigmatized identities?


### Computational Social Science

How can we best use computational methods to study questions about the social environment?
