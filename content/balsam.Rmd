# The Adaptive Behavior Lab

***

The Adaptive Behavioral Laboratory, under the direction of Peter Balsam, studies how animals learn the relationships between important events.  Using classical and operant conditioning procedures in rodents, we are interested in the behavioral and neural mechanisms of learning and motivation.  You can learn more about what we do on our lab website: http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/balsam/index.html  We may be looking for additinoal research assistants.  

We require a commitment of 10-12 hours a week (minimum) and need people who are available for at least 3-4 hour blocks of time on 2 days other than Friday or weekends, and some availability for lab meetings on Fridays.  Please contact Peter Balsam (balsam@columbia.edu) and tell us why youâ€™re interested in our work, when you are available, and your background in psychology.
