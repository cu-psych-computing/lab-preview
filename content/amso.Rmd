## Research Projects

The DCNLab is dedicated to understanding attention and executive functions, and specifically how they are shaped by childrenâ€™s lived experiences. Our work begins in infancy and extends well into adolescence. Our lab is currently operating two arms, one for community engagement and service and another for basic science in NY city and several international locations.
