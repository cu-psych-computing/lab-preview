## Description of Research Projects: 
Current projects are exploring caregiver-infant dyadic interactions through multiple lenses. We are working with several datasets capturing caregiver-infant interactions via video recordings and applying 2 distinct behavioral coding schemes to extract data points of interests. Your role as an RA would entail coding of these videos using the software Datavyu. Here, you would be exposed to the naturalistic behaviors of caregivers and their infants throughout the first year of life and gain experience with common tools used to process and analyze observational data in psychology. Additionally, you will be part of lab meetings and conversations discussing a board range of topics our lab aims to address in developmental cognitive neuroscience/psych.
