# The Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience Lab

<span style="color:green">
**The Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience Lab is currently seeking research assistants**
</span>

***

## Research Projects

Research in the Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience lab examines the psychological and neural processes involved in extracting social, emotional, and cognitive meaning from the world.

As a research assistant, your involvement may include gathering relevant articles, recruiting participants, running studies, and assisting in data analysis. The requested time commitment is about 10-15 hours per week.

The current project in need of RAs examines how couples regulate each other's emotions in daily life. Think of a time when someone close to you was sad. How did you respond to them? Why did you respond to them in the way you did? What were the consequences of your response? We investigate these questions within the context of a romantic relationship by utilizing a daily diary design.
