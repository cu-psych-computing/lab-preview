      <description>The Couples Lab The Couples Lab is not actively seeking research assistants 
In the Columbia Couples Lab we study dyadic processes (i.e. interactions between two individuals), particularly in health-relevant contexts. Our primary lines of research include how people co-experience stress, how people support each other through adversity, and how people cope with stress (e.g., do they co-ruminate?). We aim to understand how social relationships influence people’s functioning, especially during times of stress, as well as how the relationship itself functions during these adverse experiences.</description>

      <description>The Higgins Lab The Higgins Lab is not actively seeking research assistants 
In the Higgins Lab, we study the motivational underpinnings of perceptions, judgments, decisions, and behaviors in a wide range of contexts. Ongoing projects in our lab explore how different fundamental motives influence how people relate to each other, navigate their social worlds, and pursue their goals. We embrace a motivated cognition framework in pursuing both basic and applied research questions</description>
